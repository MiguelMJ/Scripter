# How to contribute
Thank you for considering contributing to this project! I hope you find it useful and enjoy using it.

Some considerations that I will ask you to keep in mind:
- If you add support for another platform that requires additional packages to be installed, make them an optional import. See how telethon is used as reference.
- Try to log the right amount of information (not too much, not too little) using the provided logging functions, not other.
- Consider using the black formatter for python code before submitting.
- Revise this file again before submitting in case something else have been added.
